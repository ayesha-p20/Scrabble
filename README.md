This is a variation of the popular word game 'Scrabble'. This project is one of my first major programs involving graphics in python.
## Built with
This program has been created in Python 3.7.0 using graphics library written by Zelle
## Usage
On the left menu, the player is provided with a list of words that fit into the grid

To enter a word into the grid, click on the word and the cell where the word should go
If the cell selected is right, the word is enters the grid and the the corresponding button on the left menu grays out

If the cell selected is wrong, the word button gets deselcted on its own and the player must select a word again

Once the grid is completed, a congratulatory message pops up in the left menu.

At any time in during or after the game, the player can hit the 'Start Over' button or the 'Quit' button to begin afresh or leave the game respectively.
